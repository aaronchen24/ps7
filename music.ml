             Conversion to and combination of music streams
 *)
  
(*......................................................................
Problem 1. Write a function list_to_stream that builds a music stream
from a finite list of musical objects. The stream should repeat this
music forever. (In order for the output to be well defined, the input
list must have at least one note. You can assume as much.) Hint: Use a
recursive helper function as defined, which will call itself
recursively on the list allowing you to keep keep the original list
around as well. Both need to be recursive, since you will call both
the inner and outer functions at some point. See below for some
examples.
......................................................................*)

  let rec list_to_stream_rec nlst =
    failwith "list_to_stream not implemented"
  in list_to_stream_rec lst ;;

(*......................................................................
Problem 2. Write a function pair that merges two event streams. Events
that happen earlier in time should appear earlier in the merged
stream. See below for some examples.
......................................................................*)
let rec pair (a : event NLS.stream) (b : event NLS.stream)
           : event NLS.stream =
  failwith "pair not implemented" ;;

(*......................................................................
Problem 3. Write a function transpose that takes an event stream and
moves each pitch up by half_steps pitches. Note that half_steps can be
negative, but this case is particularly difficult to reason about so
we've implemented it for you. See below for some examples.
......................................................................*)
let transpose_pitch ((p, oct) : pitch) (half_steps : int) : pitch =
  let newp = (p_to_int p) + half_steps in
    if newp < 0 then
      if newp mod 12 = 0 then (C, oct + (newp / 12))
      else (int_to_p (newp mod 12 + 12), oct - 1 + (newp / 12))
    else (int_to_p (newp mod 12), oct + (newp / 12))

                         Testing music streams
 *)

(* <---- (* ... UNCOMMENT THIS SECTION ONCE YOU'VE IMPLEMENTED 
                 THE FUNCTIONS ABOVE. ... *)

(*......................................................................
For testing purposes, let's start with a trivial example, useful for
checking list_to_stream, transpose, and pair functions. Start with a
simple melody1: *)

let melody1 = list_to_stream [quarter (C,3);
                              quarter_rest;
                              half (E,3)] ;;

(* This melody, when converted to a stream of start and stop events,
should look something like this:

    # NLS.first 5 melody1 ;;
    - : event list =
    [Tone (0., (C, 3), 60); Stop (0.25, (C, 3)); Tone (0.25, (E, 3), 60);
     Stop (0.5, (E, 3)); Tone (0., (C, 3), 60)]

Now, we transpose it and shift the start forward by a quarter note: *)
  
let melody2 = shift_start 0.25
                          (transpose melody1 7) ;;

(* The result is a stream that begins as

s    # NLS.first 5 melody2 ;;
    - : event list =
    [Tone (0.25, (G, 3), 60); Stop (0.25, (G, 3)); Tone (0.25, (B, 3), 60);
     Stop (0.5, (B, 3)); Tone (0., (G, 3), 60)]

Finally, combine the two as a harmony: *)
  
let harmony = pair melody1 melody2 ;;

(* The result begins like this:

    # NLS.first 10 harmony ;;
    - : event list =
    [Tone (0., (C, 3), 60); Tone (0.25, (G, 3), 60); Stop (0., (C, 3));
     Stop (0.25, (G, 3)); Tone (0., (E, 3), 60); Tone (0.25, (B, 3), 60);
     Stop (0.25, (E, 3)); Tone (0., (C, 3), 60); Stop (0.25, (B, 3));
     Tone (0., (G, 3), 60)]

You can write this out as a midi file and listen to it. *)
                              
let _ = output_midi "temp.mid" (stream_to_hex 16 harmony) ;;
   
 *)   (* <----- END OF SECTION TO UNCOMMENT. *)
   
(*......................................................................
The next example combines some scales. Uncomment these lines when you're
done implementing the functions above. You can listen
to it by opening the file "scale.mid". *)

(*
let scale1 = list_to_stream (List.map quarter
                                      [(C,3); (D,3); (E,3); (F,3); 
                                       (G,3); (A,3); (B,3); (C,4)]) ;;

let scale2 = transpose scale1 7 ;; 

let scales = pair scale1 scale2 ;; 

let _ = output_midi "scale.mid" (stream_to_hex 32 scales) ;; 
 *)

(*......................................................................
Then with just three lists provided after this comment and the
functions we defined, produce (a small part of) a great piece of
music. The piece should be four streams merged: one should be the bass
playing continuously from the beginning. The other three should be the
melody, starting 2, 4, and 6 measures from the beginning, respectively.

Define a stream canon for this piece here using the above component
streams bass and melody. Uncomment the definitions above and the lines
below when you're done. Run the program and open "canon.mid" to hear
the beautiful music. *)
